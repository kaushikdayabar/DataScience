    b.	Slicer:
        i.	If horizontal orientation of tiles is needed , then disable responsiveness
        ii.	Slicer will display values only if we have records for that value. For example, If we have 2 slicers one for year and another for month. For Year 2020,if the month slicer I displaying only Jan and Feb, it means there is no data for March-2020. Similarly, if we select June and 2020 will vanish in year slicer because there is no record for June-2020.
        iii.	Currently,Any kind of slicer could be cleared but single select should be off. Single Select option is available in Visual->FormatYourVisual->SlicerSettings->Selection.Further, to clear one specific filter click on eraser icon in top right.
        iv.	Slicers or other visuals affect other visuals by default(either highlight or filter) but we can stop this selecting the visual->format Ribbon ->edit interactions.
        v.	Apply All Slicers and clear all slicers are used for performance improvement.
        vi.	Sync Slicers option to sync slicers in multiple pages.
